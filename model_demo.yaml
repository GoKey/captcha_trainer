# ModelName: Corresponding to the model file in the model directory,
# - such as YourModelName.pb, fill in YourModelName here.
# CharSet: Provides a default optional built-in solution:
# - [ALPHANUMERIC, ALPHANUMERIC_LOWER, ALPHANUMERIC_UPPER,
# -- NUMERIC, ALPHABET_LOWER, ALPHABET_UPPER, ALPHABET]
# - Or you can use your own customized character set like: ['a', '1', '2'].
# CharExclude: CharExclude should be a list, like: ['a', '1', '2']
# - which is convenient for users to freely combine character sets.
# - If you don't want to manually define the character set manually,
# - you can choose a built-in character set
# - and set the characters to be excluded by CharExclude parameter.
